/*
    So we need to first pull in all users nfts and display them with their metadata. 

    Second a user viewing these should be able to subscribe to another user aka add that user
    to some set.

    Next when a user clicks (subscriptions) their feed will now only contain those users nft

    this is the only filtering functionality we will have until the 2nd iteration
